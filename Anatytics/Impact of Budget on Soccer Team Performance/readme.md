# Project Preview: Soccer Team Budget Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to explore the **relationship between a soccer team's budget and its on-field performance using `R Programming`**. Using a dataset from FIFA, I screened and cleaned the data to ensure `accuracy`, identified `missing values`, and addressed outliers. I performed `hypothesis testing`, focusing on the significance of transfer budgets in relation to various performance metrics such as overall rating, attack, midfield, and defense. **The findings were visualized using scatter plots and regression lines, providing clear insights into how financial resources influence team success.**

### Summary of Findings:

The t-tests revealed **significant relationships between the transfer budget and multiple team performance metrics**, supporting the alternative hypothesis. **Higher budgets are strongly associated with better overall performance**, including higher ratings in attack, midfield, defense, and prestige. **However, the negative relationship observed with club worth requires further investigation to understand potential underlying factors.**

**Skills Applied:** `Data Visualization`, `Data Cleaning and Preprocessing`, `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`, `Hypothesis Testing`, `Statistical Interpretation`.

**Packages/Libraries:** `VIM`, `ggplot2`, `rio`
