# Physical Activity Analysis Using Cell Phones and Accelerometers

## **Objective**
This project focuses on analyzing physical activity levels measured by cell phones and accelerometers. The aim is to investigate variations in physical activity between subjects and within subjects using two different measurement methods.

## **Abstract**
Physical activity is a key factor in promoting health. This study compares physical activity levels obtained through cell phone questionnaires with those from accelerometers. The analysis addresses data accuracy, missing values, outliers, and statistical assumptions to assess the agreement between the two methods and evaluate gender differences.
