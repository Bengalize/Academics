# Sorting Algorithms Performance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comparative study of various sorting algorithms implemented in Java. The goal is to analyze the performance of five different sorting algorithms: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort. The project evaluates these algorithms based on execution time, number of comparisons, and number of swaps across different data configurations.

## Features

- **Algorithms Implemented:** Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Performance Metrics:** Execution time, number of comparisons, number of swaps.
- **Data Configurations:** Randomized data, sorted data, reverse-sorted data.
- **Analysis Reports:** Detailed performance analysis based on different data configurations.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and compile the  files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithms-performance-analysis.git
cd sorting-algorithms-performance-analysis
javac *.java
```
## Usage

To run the performance analysis, execute the `Main` class. This will run the sorting algorithms on predefined data configurations and output the performance metrics to the console.

## Data Structures
The project uses a variety of data structures for analysis, including:

- **Arrays:** For storing and sorting data.
- **Lists:** To measure algorithm performance on different data structures.

## Analysis
The performance analysis includes:

- **Execution Time:** Measured in milliseconds.
- **Number of Comparisons:** Total comparisons made by the algorithm.
- **Number of Swaps:** Total swaps made by the algorithm.

Results are compared across different data configurations to understand the behavior of each sorting algorithm.
